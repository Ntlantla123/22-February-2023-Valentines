      <h4>As a favour of beautiful eyes</h4>
      <p>You know how magnets have a magical way of attracting to each other?
        That is how my heart feels when I am with you. I simply can't explain the attraction I am feeling.
         Your eyes sparkle like the stars, your hair cascades like a waterfall, and your lips are sweeter than honey.
          I love everything about you, inside and out. “I am falling and falling and falling for your entirety.”</p>

        <p class="paragraph3">Sit next to a pretty girl for an hour,
          "Solitude is painful
when one is young,
but delightful
when one is more mature.
I live in that solitude
which was painful in my youth,
but seems delicious now,
in the years of my maturity.

Now it gives me great pleasure, indeed,
to see the stubbornness
of an incorrigible nonconformist
so warmly acclaimed . . .
and yet it seems vastly strange
to be known so universally
and yet be so lonely."</p>

          The wondrous hues of joy,
          Within your tender heart,
          Like the kiss of scented breeze!

          The birds sing the sweetest melodies,
          The heart strings play a merry tune,
          And the soul dances with wonder of love,
          Life seems so awesome,
          So beautiful and precious!

          Outsoaring mine, sang such a loftier song
          As drowned the friendly cooings of my dove.
          Which owes the other most? my love was long,
          And yours one moment seemed to wax more strong;
          I loved and guessed at you, you construed me
          And loved me for what might or might not be -
          Nay, weights and measures do us both a wrong.</p>
